    <h2>What is Overproduction in Biology?</h2>
    <p>
      Overproduction is a fascinating biological concept where organisms produce more offspring than the environment can support.
      This strategy increases the chances of survival for at least some individuals, which leads to the process of natural selection
      and the evolution of species over time.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Overproduction Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Overproduction plays a crucial role in the diversity and adaptation of species. By producing a surplus of offspring,
      organisms increase their odds of survival in the face of various challenges, such as competition, predation, and environmental changes.
      Those individuals with favorable traits have a better chance of surviving and passing on those traits to future generations,
      ultimately shaping the characteristics of the entire population.
    </p>

    <h2>Examples of Overproduction</h2>
    <p>
      Overproduction can be observed in various organisms, from plants producing an abundance of seeds to animals having large litters.
      For instance, a single oak tree may produce thousands of acorns in a season, but only a few will grow into new oak trees due to limited resources
      and competition among seedlings.
    </p>

    <h2>How Overproduction Drives Evolution</h2>
    <p>
      The process of natural selection, driven by overproduction, results in the survival and reproduction of individuals with advantageous traits.
      Over time, these advantageous traits become more common in the population, while less favorable traits gradually diminish.
      This is how species adapt to their changing environments and evolve over generations.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>1. Why do organisms produce more offspring than can survive?</strong>
        <p>Overproduction increases the chances of at least some individuals surviving and passing on their genes, promoting species adaptation through natural selection.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2. How does overproduction contribute to biodiversity?</strong>
        <p>By producing a wide variety of offspring, overproduction enhances genetic diversity within a population, allowing for greater adaptability to changing environments.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>3. What are the consequences of underproduction in a population?</strong>
        <p>Underproduction can lead to reduced genetic diversity, making the population more vulnerable to environmental changes and increasing the risk of extinction.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>4. Can overproduction occur in human populations?</strong>
        <p>Overproduction in human populations may not be as pronounced as in other organisms, but it can still be observed in aspects like family size and reproduction rates.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>5. How does overproduction relate to the concept of survival of the fittest?</strong>
        <p>Overproduction creates competition for resources, and the "fittest" individuals with advantageous traits have a better chance of survival and passing on their genes.</p>
